Fast Lane
=========

The Fast Lane is MOSAIC's **zero-serialisation live visualization path**, the
first shared-memory frame streaming system in RL.  It streams live RGB frames
from a training worker subprocess directly into POSIX shared memory, bypassing
the :doc:`slow_lane` gRPC/SQLite pipeline entirely.  The GUI-side
``FastLaneConsumer`` polls the buffer every 16 ms (~60 Hz) and hands the
latest frame to a :doc:`render_tabs` ``FastLaneTab`` for Qt Quick display.

Unlike existing approaches that either render in-process (blocking training, as
warned by NVIDIA's Isaac Lab documentation) or stream via network sockets
(NVIDIA sim-web-visualizer), Fast Lane completely decouples visualization from
the training loop: the worker writes frames without ever waiting for the GUI,
and the GUI reads without ever blocking the worker.

Prior shared-memory systems in RL (OpenAI Baselines ``ShmemVecEnv``, Sample
Factory's shared tensors, EnvPool's ``StateBufferQueue``, TorchRL's circular
buffers) all transfer **training data** (observations, trajectories, weights)
between workers.  Fast Lane is the first to apply shared memory to
**visualization output**: rendered RGB frames streamed to a desktop GUI at
display refresh rates with a sub-5 microsecond publish path and empirically
decoupled writer/reader throughput.  End-to-end training-loop overhead when
FastLane is enabled is framework-dependent and reported in the main MOSAIC
paper.

SPSC Ring Buffer
----------------

The core is a **Single-Producer, Single-Consumer (SPSC) ring buffer** in POSIX
shared memory (``multiprocessing.shared_memory``).  The architecture is
inspired by the LMAX Disruptor pattern (Thompson et al., 2011), adapted for
CPython's runtime model.  Implementation lives in
``gym_gui/fastlane/buffer.py``.

Data Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::
   :widths: 22 78
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Class
     - Fields
   * - ``FastLaneConfig``
     - ``width``, ``height``, ``channels=3``, ``pixel_format="RGB"``,
       ``capacity=128``, ``metadata_size=0``
   * - ``FastLaneFrame``
     - ``data: bytes``, ``width``, ``height``, ``channels``,
       ``metrics: FastLaneMetrics``, ``metadata: bytes | None``
   * - ``FastLaneMetrics``
     - ``last_reward: float``, ``rolling_return: float``,
       ``step_rate_hz: float``

All three are frozen dataclasses.


Sequence-Number Consistency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The writer and reader coordinate without locks using an **odd/even sequence
number protocol** (inspired by the Linux kernel seqlock pattern).  The reader
detects torn reads via the ``seq1 == seq2`` check and retries the next slot,
which is why the protocol tolerates non-atomic ``struct.pack_into`` writes:
it needs store ordering (provided by x86 TSO) plus torn-read detection, not
per-write atomicity:

1. **Write path**: ``FastLaneWriter.publish(frame, *, metrics, metadata) → int``:

   - Computes ``slot = head % capacity``.
   - Writes ``seq = head * 2 + 1`` into the slot header (*odd* = write in progress).
   - Copies RGB payload bytes into the slot.
   - Writes ``seq = head * 2 + 2`` (*even* = committed).
   - Advances ``head`` in the shared header.

2. **Read path**: ``FastLaneReader.latest_frame() → FastLaneFrame | None``:

   - Reads ``seq1`` from the slot header.
   - If ``seq1 % 2 == 1`` → write in progress, skip to next slot.
   - Copies the payload bytes.
   - Reads ``seq2`` and verifies ``seq1 == seq2`` → data is consistent.
   - On mismatch → skip (torn read detected).

.. note::

   The correctness of this protocol rests on two mechanisms; neither is the
   GIL.  The writer and reader run in **separate OS processes**, each with
   its own CPython interpreter, so neither process's GIL provides any
   cross-process memory visibility guarantee.  What actually makes the
   pattern safe on the current supported target:

   1. **x86 Total Store Order (TSO).**  Stores from the writer's core become
      visible to any other core in program order.  The odd "in-progress"
      sequence write, the payload copy, and the even "committed" sequence
      write are therefore observed in that order by an x86 reader on a
      different core.
   2. **The seq1 == seq2 retry check.**  The reader's odd-parity check plus
      the post-copy ``seq1 == seq2`` comparison detects any torn read
      (writer advanced mid-copy); ``latest_frame`` then retries the next
      slot.  This is why the protocol tolerates ``struct.pack_into`` not
      being an atomic primitive: it needs store *ordering* plus torn-read
      detection, not atomicity.

   On weakly ordered architectures (ARM, POWER) the ordering guarantee no
   longer holds without explicit memory barriers, so the current
   ``struct.pack_into`` implementation would need to be replaced with C11
   atomic stores.  This is why ``test_fastlane_memory_ordering.py`` pins
   the writer and reader to separate cores to maximize cache-coherency
   traffic on x86, and calls out ARM as the case where the same protocol
   would surface missing fences.  See the *Limitations* section below for
   the ``atomics``-package migration path.

3. **Metrics path**: ``FastLaneReader.metrics() → FastLaneMetrics``:
   reads ``last_reward``, ``rolling_return``, ``step_rate_hz`` directly from
   the header doubles.

Factory Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   # Worker side
   writer = FastLaneWriter.create(
       run_id,
       FastLaneConfig(width=84, height=84, channels=3, capacity=128),
   )
   seq = writer.publish(frame_bytes, metrics=FastLaneMetrics(...))

   # GUI side
   reader = FastLaneReader.attach(run_id)
   frame  = reader.latest_frame()

Design Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **SPSC only**: one writer, one reader, no mutexes.
2. **Lossy**: the consumer always jumps to the latest sequence; old frames are
   silently overwritten.
3. **Batch-friendly**: no frame debt; the reader skips ahead.
4. **Simple payload**: tight-packed RGB(A) bytes; HUD scalars in the header.
5. **Invalidation**: ``FLAG_INVALIDATED`` tells the reader that the writer
   has exited and the buffer should be re-attached.

Frame Tiling
------------

When a worker uses vectorized environments,
``tile_frames(frames: Sequence[np.ndarray]) → np.ndarray`` composites *N*
sub-environment frames into a near-square grid (``rows = ceil(sqrt(N))``,
``cols = ceil(N / rows)``).  This follows the ``tile_images()`` pattern from
the Stable-Baselines3 codebase (not described in the SB3 JMLR paper, but a
widely-used utility in the SB3 ``VecEnv`` implementation) and allows streaming
multiple environments in a single Fast Lane slot.

Worker Integration Helpers
--------------------------

``apply_fastlane_environment()`` injects canonical environment variables into
a worker's subprocess launch dict:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 38 62
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Environment Variable
     - Description
   * - ``MOSAIC_FASTLANE_ONLY``
     - ``"1"`` or ``"0"``: skip :doc:`slow_lane` telemetry
   * - ``MOSAIC_FASTLANE_SLOT``
     - Which vectorized-env index feeds the writer
   * - ``MOSAIC_FASTLANE_VIDEO_MODE``
     - ``"single"`` | ``"grid"`` | ``"off"``
   * - ``MOSAIC_FASTLANE_GRID_LIMIT``
     - Max environments composited in grid mode (default 4)

.. code-block:: python

   def apply_fastlane_environment(
       env: Dict[str, Any],
       *,
       fastlane_only: bool,
       fastlane_slot: int,
       video_mode: str = "SINGLE",
       grid_limit: int = 4,
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...

FastLaneConsumer
----------------

``FastLaneConsumer`` (``gym_gui/ui/fastlane_consumer.py``) is a ``QObject``
that bridges shared memory to Qt signals.

**Polling loop**: a ``QTimer`` fires every **16 ms**:

1. If not connected → attempt ``FastLaneReader.attach(run_id)``.
2. Check ``FLAG_INVALIDATED`` → trigger reconnection.
3. Validate header (``capacity > 0``, ``slot_size > 0``).
4. Read ``reader.latest_frame()`` → convert bytes to ``QImage``
   (``Format_RGB888`` or ``Format_RGBA8888``).
5. Emit ``frame_ready(FastLaneFrameEvent)`` with the ``QImage`` and a
   HUD string: ``"reward: {:.2f}\nreturn: {:.2f}\nstep/sec: {:.1f}"``.

**Signals:**

- ``frame_ready(FastLaneFrameEvent)``: image + HUD text + optional metadata.
- ``status_changed(str)``: ``"connected"`` | ``"reconnecting"`` |
  ``"fastlane-unavailable"``.

FastLaneTab
-----------

``FastLaneTab`` (``gym_gui/ui/widgets/fastlane_tab.py``) hosts a
``QQuickWidget`` loading ``FastLaneView.qml`` for GPU-accelerated rendering.
See :doc:`render_tabs` for how it plugs into the central tab widget.

.. code-block:: python

   FastLaneTab(
       run_id: str,
       agent_id: str,
       *,
       mode_label: str | None = None,   # default "Fast lane"
       run_mode: str | None = None,     # "train" | "policy_eval"
       parent: QWidget | None = None,
   )

**Modes:**

- ``"train"`` (default): live frames + reward / step-rate HUD.
- ``"policy_eval"``: adds an evaluation summary overlay that reloads
  ``eval_summary.json`` every 1 s (batch count, episodes, avg/min/max return).


Prior Art and How Fast Lane Builds on It
----------------------------------------

Fast Lane stands on the shoulders of shared-memory IPC techniques developed
across RL and systems engineering.  Below is an honest accounting of what
was inherited and what is new.

**Shared memory for RL observation transfer** was pioneered by OpenAI
Baselines' ``ShmemVecEnv``
(`Dhariwal et al., 2017 <https://github.com/openai/baselines>`_), which uses
``multiprocessing.Array`` to communicate observations between environment
subprocesses and the training process.
`Sample Factory <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11751>`_
(Petrenko et al., ICML 2020) extended this by storing *"trajectories,
observations, or hidden states"* as *"preallocated tensors in system RAM"*
with *"no data serialization"*, achieving over 1 GB/s throughput.  Sample
Factory applies shared memory to the **training data path**
(``share_memory_()`` on PyTorch tensors for observations, actions, and
trajectories, with buffer indices passed through ``faster-fifo`` FIFO
queues); its codebase contains no visualization infrastructure.
`EnvPool <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10558>`_
(Weng et al., NeurIPS 2022) introduced the ``StateBufferQueue``, a lock-free
circular buffer in C++ for asynchronous batched state delivery.
`TorchRL <https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00577>`_
(Bou et al., 2023) uses circular preallocated memory buffers for observation
transfer in ``ParallelEnv``.

**All of the above apply shared memory exclusively to the training data path.**
None has a GUI, a live viewer, or any visualization component.

**Lock-free ring buffer architecture** originates from the
`LMAX Disruptor <https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/disruptor.html>`_
(Thompson et al., 2011), where *"all memory visibility and correctness
guarantees are implemented using memory barriers and/or compare-and-swap
operations."*  Fast Lane adapts this pattern for CPython on x86 by leaning
on Total Store Order for store ordering plus a seq-mismatch retry for
torn-read detection, instead of explicit hardware memory fences (see the
seqlock note above).

**Frame tiling for vectorized environments** follows the ``tile_images()``
utility in the
`Stable-Baselines3 <https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-1364.html>`_
codebase (Raffin et al., JMLR 2021), which composites N sub-environment
frames into a near-square grid.

**Contributions.**
MOSAIC's FastLane introduces three contributions to RL visualization:

1. **Shared-memory frame streaming.** The first application of shared-memory
   inter-process communication to rendered RGB frames in a reinforcement
   learning system.  All prior shared-memory mechanisms in RL (OpenAI
   Baselines, Sample Factory, EnvPool, TorchRL) transfer training data
   exclusively.
2. **Process-level decoupling.** Complete process-level decoupling of
   visualization from the training loop.  The publishing worker writes frames
   to the SPSC ring buffer without blocking on the consuming GUI process, and
   the GUI reads the latest available frame without stalling the worker.
3. **Microsecond-scale publish latency and measured writer/reader
   decoupling.**  The ``publish()`` call sustains p50 ~2.9 μs and p99
   ~4.8 μs at 84x84 RGB, and writer throughput varies by only ~2.5%
   whether the reader runs at 0, 1, or 60 Hz. That is the mathematical
   definition of lock-free streaming.  Measured on CartPole-v1 across seven publishing
   frameworks (CleanRL, SBX, XuanCe, SB3, Tianshou, TorchRL, RLlib) at
   100,000 steps with five seeds per condition.

   End-to-end training-loop overhead when FastLane is enabled is a separate,
   framework-dependent quantity (1.26x on Tianshou to 4.81x on SBX on
   CartPole-v1, per the FastLane column of the main MOSAIC paper's
   wrapper-overhead table).  This cost lives in the per-step frame
   extraction path inside each framework's own actor loop, not inside the
   ring buffer; frameworks with the fastest baseline steps (SBX's JIT'd
   step) see the largest relative overhead precisely because their baseline
   is so fast.  The paper's *Worker overhead* (${\leq}\,1.05\times$ on six
   of eight frameworks) is a distinct measurement of the subprocess-wrapper
   cost with FastLane off.

No prior RL system achieves all three properties simultaneously.  NVIDIA's
`sim-web-visualizer <https://github.com/NVlabs/sim-web-visualizer>`_ (2022)
streams frames over ZeroMQ, incurring kernel network stack and serialization
overhead even on localhost.  Isaac Lab's Rerun-based visualizer (2024) renders
within the training process, consuming training-loop cycles, a limitation
acknowledged in NVIDIA's own documentation.

Empirical Validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following benchmarks were run on Ubuntu 22.04 (x86-64, ERYING Polestar
Z790, CPython 3.11).  All tests pass with zero errors.

**Throughput vs. Frame Resolution**: Fast Lane sustains 354K FPS at CartPole
resolution (84x84) and 21K FPS at HD (640x480), far exceeding the 60 FPS
target at every resolution.  The blue line shows actual throughput; the dashed
coral line shows what would happen with linear (serialization-based) scaling.
Sub-linear degradation proves the protocol overhead is O(1).

.. image:: /_static/figures/benchmarks/fastlane_fig_a_throughput.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: FastLane throughput vs frame resolution

**Writer Decoupling from Reader Speed**: Writer throughput is 337K fps with
no reader, 329K fps with a 1 Hz reader, and 328K fps with a 60 Hz reader
(2.5% variance, within OS scheduling noise).  This proves the writer never
waits for the reader. That is the mathematical definition of lock-free
streaming.
The 337K "no reader" baseline is slightly below the 354K figure above because
the two numbers come from different benchmark files:
``test_fastlane_resolution.py`` runs 20,000 frames in a tight loop with no
reader-subprocess machinery around it, while ``test_fastlane_decoupling.py``
runs 50,000 frames under the multi-process harness with ``capacity=64`` in
every condition (including "no reader"), which changes cache footprint and
scheduling.  Both are correct measurements of what they claim; they are not
two attempts at the same measurement.

   :alt: FastLane writer decoupling proof

**Publish Latency vs. Frame Size**: All resolutions remain far below the
16,667 μs budget required for 60 Hz (dashed line).  Even at 640x480 HD,
publish latency is 46 μs, which is 362x faster than needed.  The log scale reveals
the massive headroom at every resolution.

Per-Framework FastLane Overhead
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enabling FastLane adds a per-step frame extraction cost inside each worker's
actor loop.  The overhead is framework-dependent: frameworks with faster
baseline steps (e.g., SBX's JIT-compiled step) show the largest relative
overhead precisely because their baseline is so fast.  The following two plots
summarise the overhead measured across seven publishing frameworks (CleanRL,
SBX, XuanCe, SB3, Tianshou, TorchRL, RLlib) on CartPole-v1, 100,000 steps,
five seeds per condition.

**Overhead ratio per framework**: ratio of FastLane-enabled steps/s to native
steps/s.  Values above 1.0 indicate negligible overhead; values below 1.0
indicate a slowdown due to frame extraction in the worker's actor loop.

(no FastLane), worker-wrapped (subprocess overhead only), and FastLane-enabled
conditions, across all seven frameworks.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Single-machine constraint.**
FastLane requires both the training worker and the GUI process to run on the
same operating system kernel.  POSIX shared memory (``mmap``) works by mapping
the same physical RAM pages into two process address spaces; across two
machines there is no shared physical RAM and no bridge.  This is the same
tradeoff made by Sample Factory
(`Petrenko et al., 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11751>`_), which
restricts its shared-memory IPC to single-machine settings in exchange for
eliminating serialization overhead entirely.  Distributed deployments, where
workers run on remote compute nodes, fall back to the
:doc:`Slow Lane's <slow_lane>` gRPC transport, which works across any network
boundary.

**Memory model.**
The current implementation relies on x86 Total Store Order (TSO).  Portability
to ARM processors or Python 3.13+ free-threading (PEP 703) would require
replacing ``struct.pack_into`` with C11 atomic stores via the ``atomics``
package, a straightforward change deferred to future work.
